\section*{Snapshot 1 — Start Objectives}

The purpose of Snapshot 1 is to establish the foundation of the Career Help Platform. 
This phase focuses entirely on planning, project structure, and documentation requirements. 
The system architecture, goals, and initial design decisions are defined here.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Define the project scope:}  
    The Career Help Platform assists users in selecting career paths and provides curated recommendations for colleges, certificates, internships, jobs, and experience-building opportunities.

    \item \textbf{Establish core architecture:}  
    A web-based frontend, backend recommendation engine, and a structured data layer are planned.  
    A future paid counseling module will be integrated in later snapshots.

    \item \textbf{Create initial documentation:}  
    Version 1.0 of the SRS, SDD, README/User Manual, and Design Specification are created.

    \item \textbf{Plan project dependencies and technologies:}  
    The system design includes Python Flask for backend planning and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend (no code implementation required at this stage).  
    Docker containerization will be incorporated in future snapshots.

    \item \textbf{Create Jira board:}  
    Tasks are created for UI layout, backend logic planning, data design, documentation work, and future bug tracking.

    \item \textbf{Create workflow diagram:}  
    A high-level depiction showing user input flowing through the UI, backend recommendation logic, data retrieval, and final results displayed to the user.
\end{itemize}
