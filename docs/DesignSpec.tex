\maketitle

\section{Overview}
This document provides a detailed design specification of the Career Help Platform. 
It breaks down every major component of the system, including pages, modules, tools, and required dependencies.

\section{Page Breakdown}
\subsection{Home Page}
Displays introduction and allows user to begin selecting a career path.

\subsection{Career Selection Page}
Contains a dropdown list of careers and a button to generate recommendations.

\subsection{Recommendations Page}
Displays colleges, certificates, internships, jobs, and experience required for the chosen career.

\section{Component Breakdown}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Career Selector Module:} Accepts user input.
    \item \textbf{Recommendation Engine:} Retrieves data based on the career.
    \item \textbf{Data Layer:} Stored as JSON or database.
    \item \textbf{Counseling Module (future):} Handles paid 1-on-1 sessions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dependencies and Libraries}
Planned dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python Flask (backend)
    \item HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend)
    \item JSON data storage
\end{itemize}

\section{Docker Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python 3.10 base image
    \item Copy project files into container
    \item Expose port 5000
\end{itemize}


\section{Snapshot 2 Design: AI Career Roadmap Generator}

\subsection{Chatbot Interaction Design}
The primary entry point for the new feature is the chatbot-style UI. The following interaction pattern is expected:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The user types a natural language request for a career roadmap.
    \item The UI displays the user message in the conversation history.
    \item The frontend sends the message and any structured form data to the backend API.
    \item The UI displays a loading indicator while the roadmap is generated.
    \item The final roadmap is rendered as a series of sections or bullet lists within the chat window.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backend Endpoint Specification}
A new backend endpoint is defined conceptually as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Method:} POST
    \item \textbf{Path:} \texttt{/career-roadmap}
    \item \textbf{Request Body:} JSON containing major, interests, experience level, and target career goal.
    \item \textbf{Response:} JSON structure including one or more phases, each with recommended actions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration with Existing Components}
The Career Roadmap Generator reuses and extends the planned recommendation engine by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding AI-generated narrative guidance on top of static recommendations.
    \item Allowing the same data layer (for example, predefined careers or skills) to be referenced in the AI prompts.
    \item Keeping the design flexible enough to plug in future features like class schedule search or live internship feeds.
\end{itemize}
