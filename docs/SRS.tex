\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Career Help Platform. The system provides users with career pathways including educational resources, certifications, internships, and job recommendations.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developers planning future implementation.
    \item Testers evaluating system requirements.
    \item Students, advisors, and project stakeholders.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}
The system will guide users through selecting a career and receiving a personalized roadmap. Future versions will include optional paid counseling.

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Career selection dropdown.
    \item Results section displaying required education, certifications, experience, and jobs.
    \item Clean, web-based UI.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Backend recommendation engine (planned).
    \item Data storage using structured JSON or database.
\end{itemize}

\section{Legal and Ethical Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User preferences are not to be stored without consent.
    \item Recommendations must avoid bias or discrimination.
    \item Paid counseling information must be disclosed transparently.
\end{itemize}


\section{Snapshot 2 Functional Requirements}

\subsection{New Functional Requirements for Career Roadmap Generation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FR-CR1: Collect Student Inputs} \\
    The system shall allow a student to provide their major or program, areas of interest, current academic standing, and target career goal.

    \item \textbf{FR-CR2: Generate Multi-Phase Roadmap} \\
    The system shall generate a multi-phase roadmap that includes suggested academic steps, skills to build, project ideas, and internship milestones relevant to the student\'s goal.

    \item \textbf{FR-CR3: Chat-Based Interaction} \\
    The system shall allow the student to request a career roadmap through a chat-style interface using natural language queries.

    \item \textbf{FR-CR4: Output Formatting} \\
    The roadmap shall be returned in a readable format, broken into clear phases such as Year 1--4 or equivalent terms, and presented in the chatbot output.

    \item \textbf{FR-CR5: Handling Missing Information} \\
    If the student does not provide enough information (for example, no major or goal), the system shall ask follow-up questions before generating a roadmap.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Updated Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NFR-CR1: Response Time} \\
    Under normal load, a roadmap request should complete in 10 seconds or less, assuming the external AI service is available.

    \item \textbf{NFR-CR2: Clarity of Guidance} \\
    The roadmap must be presented in a clear, organized way that is understandable to students with no prior experience in career planning.

    \item \textbf{NFR-CR3: Privacy and Ethics} \\
    Student inputs used to generate the roadmap must not be stored permanently without consent and should not include sensitive personal identifiers unless absolutely necessary.
\end{itemize}
